Project Title: Real Time Bus Tracker
ProjectDescription: In tis project I used CSS to Track or animate bus stop to User or Customer. I added a button to map and then I used Marker to no. of Bus stop
How to Run: Please use Visual Studio and create  index.html file and then use this URL 'https://api-v3.mbta.com/vehicles?filter[route]=1&include=trip  which will request Bus data.
Create mapanimation.js and follow the step in this file and also add style.css file to style your map grid
Roadmap of future improvements: I plan to add Metro station as well and add trains tracker too.
